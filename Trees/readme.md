### Note: 
```
int is a primitive data type, and when you pass it to a method, it's passed by value, not by reference.
Therefore, any modifications made to res inside the Helper method won't reflect
outside the method(calling function) because you're modifying a copy of the original res

-> in place of that we can use the array or arraylist
```
